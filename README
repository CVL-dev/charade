Charade is an ssh-agent in cygwin that proxies requests to pageant.

If you don't use cygwin or pageant, you don't need charade.

Background: I tolerate Windows XP. I actually quite like it. But it
needs putty, and it needs cygwin to be usable. I used to maintain
two separate sets of ssh keys: one for putty, which I kept in pageant,
and another for cygwin's openssh, which I kept in ssh-agent/keychain.

Eventually I got fed up maintaining two key pairs and charade was born.

It's really just a program that pretends to be ssh-agent on one side
and pretends to be putty on the other.

How do you run it? Just like ssh-agent.
